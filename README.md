# Graph-search-algorithms

The project will aim at developing the Graph Search algorithms using the Python programming language. Specifically, some of the conventiona graph search methods which will be adopted in the project include uniformed|blind(BFS&DFS) and informed(UCS) . These conventional graph search methods have been considered paramount or important in computer science and artificial intelligence in solving a given problem.

# Algorithms it includes:

BFS(Breadth-First Search):Explores nodes level by level. Tests a shortest path is found when an unweighted graph is explored.

DFS (Depth-First Search):Go as far as possible along that branch before backtracking.This is a memory-efficient method but does not give the shortest path.

UCS (Uniform Cost Search):Expands nodes on the basis of their cost"WEIGHTED GRAPH". Enforces the minimality condition in the weighted graphs.
